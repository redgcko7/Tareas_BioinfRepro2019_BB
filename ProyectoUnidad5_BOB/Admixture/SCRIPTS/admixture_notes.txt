## Admixture

# This script converts the vcf file from the original publication to a plink .bed file for
# analyis in Admixture, checking for the optimal number of populations (K = 1-9)
# using the cross-validation errors.

# In addition, this script includes an R-script that plots the 9 Admixture plots for visualization.

# set working directory to Admixture folder, which should contain three sub-folders (DATA, FIGURES, SCRIPTS)


# set up vcf tools in docker biocontainers in order to convert vcf to plink
## need to have docker installed
docker pull biocontainers/vcftools:0.1.15

# make shortcut for vcftools, linking it to data
# USE YOUR INDIVIDUAL PATH TO ADMIXTURE FOLDER 
vcftools="docker run --rm -v /Users/bbutler7/Desktop/Tareas_BioinfRepro2019_BB/ProyectoUnidad5_BOB/Admixture:/data biocontainers/vcftools:0.1.15 vcftools"

# convert from vcf to plink
$vcftools --vcf data/80missingdata.singleSNP.vcf --plink --out data/80missingdata.singleSNP

# convert ped to bed
# must have plink executable in DATA folder
DATA/plink --file DATA/80missingdata.singleSNP --make-bed --out DATA/80missingdata.singleSNP

# Run Admixture with cross-validation errors in loop
# make sure .fam and .bim files are in DATA folder, with .bed and admixture executable
cd DATA

# to view CV errors:
grep -h CV log*.out >> Admixture.CVerrors.txt
# lowest CV error is most likely K value

# to plot:
