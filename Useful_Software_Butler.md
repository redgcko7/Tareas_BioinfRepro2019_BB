# Examples of Useful Software for my Research

## *Beast
### About
This software is useful for phylogenetic and species tree inference. Particularly, it can estimate **divergence times** between lineages using dating techniques (relaxed clock, fossil calibrations, etc.). It also uses **coalescent methods** to output a species tree, instead of concatenated gene trees.

### Cons
Can be slow for large datasets.
Not Suitable for situations where gene flow/admixture occurs.

### How it applies to my research
\*Beast can be used to date the divergences of the major clades, which is useful in inferring biogeographic history of the Genus *Coleonyx*. For Example, the divergence date between the two major clades (North and South) may be informative of the biogeographic processes involved in the split (i.e. Mountain uplift, flooding of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, etc.)

It will also be useful for creating a resolved phylogeny of the genus using coalescent methods, which is useful for understanding the relationships of the 8 species.

## Arlequin
### About
This multi-use program is useful for a variety of population-genetics analyses, including AMOVA's, determining nucleotide diversity, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, Tajima's D, Fu's F, etc. These analyses can infer demographic history of populations, and population distinctiveness.

### Cons
Requires a priori assignment of individuals to populations (can use **Admixture** or **STRUCTURE** to get this).

Data formatting is required prior to analysis

### How it applies to my research
These analyses in **Arlequin** can be used to investigate the genetic distinctiveness of the two recognized subspecies of *Coleonyx elegans*. Gene flow between populations, analyses of genetic variance, historical population size, etc. is helpful in inferring the evolutionary history of this species, and if the two subspecies deserve to be elevated to species-level. It can also prove useful for evaluating proposed phylogeographic barriers that have affected the evolution of this species.

## Stacks
### About
This program is useful for processing **RAD-seq** data and facilitating down-stream analyses.

### Cons
None :)

### How it applies to my research
As I will be generating RADseq data for both species-level and population-level analyses, **Stacks** will be vital in organizing, filter, and overall processing this data for input into specialized phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses.
